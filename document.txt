When using loopback interface (IPv4 address 127.0.0.1 or IPv6 address ::1), data never leaves the host or touches the external network. 
Applications use the loopback interface to communicate with other processes running on the host and for security and isolation from the eternal network.
Since it's internal and accessible only from within the host, it's not exposed. When you use an IP address other than 127.0.0.1 or ::1 in your applications,
it's probably nound to an Ethernet interface that's connected to an external network. This is your gateway to other hosts outside of your "localhost" kingdom.
